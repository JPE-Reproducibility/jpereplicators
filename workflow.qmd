You have just received an assigment email about package `Author-1234`. You have carefully read it. Now what?

# First Round or Subsequent Round?

There is a distinction between first round and subsequent round packages. On your `git` repo, each round is a different *branch*. That is, when you clone this for the first time, you see that you have branch `round1`. How to see this? 👇

```bash
git branch 
```

👉 Watch out in the `git` operations below.

:::


## Package Acquisition

1. Get or update repo:
   1. If this is the first round, clone the git repo (using url in your email) to your computer. For example to `~/JPE-replications/Author-1234`. That would be
   
        ```bash
        cd ~/JPE-replications/Author-1234
        git clone url_in_email
        ```

   2. If this is subsequent round `n`, say `n=3`, you just have to get the next round branch:
   
        ```bash
        cd ~/JPE-replications/Author-1234
        git branch -r  # check which remote branches are available
        git checkout -b round3 origin/round3 # creates local branch round3 from remote branch round3
        ```

2. Download dropbox folder with full package and paper. That's the second URL in your email.
3. Extract package (if compressed), and copy **into** the git repo as `~/JPE-replications/Author-1234/replication-package`

# Danger Zone ⛔️

Do **not** copy the replication package anywhere else on your computer (maybe because you are uncomfortable with `git`). Copying files back and forth manually on your computer is a recipe for assured disaster - don't go there.

## First Compilation of report 

1. Before doing anything else, open VScode at `~/JPE-replications/Author-1234`.
2. Open file `TEMPLATE.qmd`
3. Hit `Shift-Cmd-K` or open command palette and type `quarto: preview`
4. You will see the template I prepared for this round of the package. Make sure it looks ok and all my prepared content shows up.

## Doing the Replication and Preparing Report

Start working on the job, by going through `TEMPLATE.qmd` and make edits as required.

## Submitting report

This again differs by whether first or subsequent round.

**First round:**


```bash
git add package-output-map.xlsx
git add images # for your screenshots
git add TEMPLATE.qmd  # your edits
git add TEMPLATE.pdf  # the compiled version of your report
git add TEMPLATE-APPENDIX.qmd  # if you made any edits
git commit -m 'first round report. code breaks. missing citations.'
git push origin round1  # pushes back to `round1` branch - this must be the branch you cloned from, don't create a new branch!
```

**round `n`:**

> Let's say again that `n=3`.

```bash
git add package-output-map.xlsx
git add images # for your screenshots
git add TEMPLATE.qmd  # your edits
git add TEMPLATE.pdf  # the compiled version of your report
git add TEMPLATE-APPENDIX.qmd  # if you made any edits
git commit -m 'round 3 report. almost done. still missing citations.'
git push origin round3  # pushes back to `round3` branch
```
