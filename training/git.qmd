# 🛠️ Pre-Workshop Setup Guide: Git + GitHub (HTTPS Authentication)

Welcome to the Git Workshop! Follow these steps **before the session** to make sure you're ready to use Git and GitHub with HTTPS authentication.

---

## ✅ Prerequisites

Make sure you have:

- [x] Git installed (check with `git --version`)
- [x] A GitHub account (https://github.com)
- [x] A working terminal (e.g. Git Bash on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux)

---

## 🔐 Step 1: Set Up Git Credential Storage

To avoid entering your credentials every time, configure Git to store them securely.

### 🔹 Windows

```bash
git config --global credential.helper manager-core
```

### 🔹 macOS

```bash
git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain
```

### 🔹 Linux

```bash
git config --global credential.helper cache
```

> 💡 You only need to run this once per system.

## 🧾 Step 2: Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT)

1. Visit: [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Click **"Generate new token (classic)"**
3. Fill in the form:
   - **Note**: `Git Workshop Token`
   - **Expiration**: `90 days`
   - **Scopes**:
     - ✅ `repo` – full access to GitHub repositories
     - ✅ `workflow` – allows triggering and viewing GitHub Actions
4. Click **Generate token**
5. **Copy the token now** — you won’t be able to see it again.  
   ➤ Save it in a **safe place on your computer**, like a plain text file:  
   `my-github-token.txt`

---

## ☑️ Step 3: Test Your HTTPS Setup

Run the following command to verify that Git can connect to GitHub using HTTPS:

```bash
git ls-remote https://github.com/github/gitignore.git
```

You will be prompted for your GitHub **username** and your **Personal Access Token** as the password.

- ✅ If it returns a list of references (e.g. `refs/heads/main`), you're ready.
- ❌ If authentication fails, double-check that your token has the correct scopes and hasn't expired.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Step 4: Set Your Git Identity

Set your name and email so commits are properly attributed.

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Full Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
```

Notice that this email does not have to correspond to what you used on github.com, but it should be an address where you are indeed reachable.

---

## ✅ Final Checklist

- [ ] Git installed and working
- [ ] GitHub account ready
- [ ] Credential helper configured
- [ ] Personal Access Token created and saved
- [ ] Test command (`git ls-remote`) successful
- [ ] Git name and email configured

You're now ready for the workshop!
